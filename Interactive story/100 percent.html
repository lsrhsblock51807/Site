  <h1>Game 7 of the world series.</h1>
  <h2> As your title search wanes to a close did you have what it takes to win it all?
  <p> That extra 100% was the best thing you
did because you won! The players kept
going and expanded the lead to 13-6
for your first world series win! You did
very well and everyone is already looking
to defend that title. Good job!</p>
