   <p>Good citizenship is not just about doing things here and there,
     it also requires making daily decisions that don't just benefit you.
   A good citizen always looks out for those who cannot always look out for themselves.
   Being honest, compassionate and courageous are among the chief characteristics of a model citizen.
   <p> Each characteristic of a good citizen is equally important as the other. For example, one would not have the motivation
     to help someone without compassion and an understanding of their situation.
   <p> Here are some things that you can do every day
     that can make you a better citizen
     <ul>
<Li> Helping someone with ther groceries</li>
  <Li> holding the door for others</Li>
    <Li>  Helping someone when they're hurt</Li>
      <Li> Just being a nice person day in and day out</Li>
    </ul>
<p> I myself performed such an act of citizenahip by helping someone in the store who had dropped all of
  her items on the store. Instead of just walking by like a normal pedestrian,
  I wanted to take the initiative to step up and be better. After, I couldn't help but
  feel quite staisfied with what i did. Which further affirmed the notion that citizenship actually makes you feel better.
